# Robot Speaker 1.1

## Description
Robot Speaker 1.1 is a program created by Ayushman that converts text into speech using the built-in text-to-speech functionality on your system. It allows you to enter any text, and the program will speak it out loud. Additionally, you can quit the program by entering 'q' as the input.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- macOS or Linux operating system (for the 'say' command to work)

## Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the 'robot_speaker.py' file is located.
3. Run the program using the following command:
4. The program will display a welcome message and prompt you to enter your speech.
5. Type any text you want the robot speaker to say and press Enter.
6. The robot speaker will convert the text into speech and play it through your system's speakers.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 to enter additional speech inputs.
8. To exit the program, enter 'q' as the input. The program will say "bye bye friend" and terminate.

## Example
The program will say "Hello, how are you?" out loud.

## Note
- The 'say' command used in the program is specific to macOS and Linux systems. If you're using a different operating system, you might need to modify the code to use a different text-to-speech command.
